Q4)
Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java at class level ?

A4)
java does not support multilevel inheritance because it's increase complexity.if class A is child class and class B
and class C is super class.if B & C have same method with method it should call.
ex)
class A{
void one(){
System.out.println("one A");
}
}
class B{
void one(){
System.out.println("one B");
}
}
class C extends A,B{
public static void main(String args[]){
C s1=new C();
s1.one();
}
}
